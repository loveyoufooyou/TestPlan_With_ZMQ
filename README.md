## 2. Run
We only run the web.py and main.py .

But before we do that, you could need to write down names of functions in the test_plan.csv .

Click the 'test' to run test, you can click 'stop' button to stop running program of tests.

## 3. Why?
- The web.py and main.py are separated, because console and hardware are separated.
- Using ZMQ, because of selection of communication between hardware and other devices.
